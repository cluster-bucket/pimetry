A personal information manager built on REST, OPML, and Javascript

Introduction
------------

Our data is fragmented across the web and the physical world. From email to 
bills, links, contacts, appointments, and books, our operating context is
perpetually shifting. But what if all of it could be coalesced? The frantic 
harried pace could come to a peacful rest. 

But how does one manage the vast amounts of information that scattered throughout
one's personal life? And how can one meaningfully assimilate knowledge from
all those numbers and facts? It is not found in heavy methodology. Pimetry thinks 
that the solution is simple: put everything important in one harmonious place.
